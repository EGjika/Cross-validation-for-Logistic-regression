With this app, you can:

Upload your dataset and select target and predictor variables.
Choose the number of folds (k) for cross-validation.
View a detailed summary of the model's performance, including mean accuracy and standard deviation.
Visualize how k impacts model accuracy through a dynamic plot.
This tool is perfect for understanding how cross-validation works and its role in improving model reliability. 

Give it a try and enhance your logistic regression workflows! ðŸš€

Note: the error shows becaus eyour target variable is not in the format 0/1 (in my data sample it is Y/N)
